                    Yes, the Open Approach covers all subjects. And, your learning coach will lead you to where you can find your child's books. If you prefer buying pre-packaged learning materials, the Boxed Approach might work best for your situation. <br><br>For your convenience, we’ve listed DepEd-approved K-12 books that we highly recommend. Also, we’re still waiting for our partner school, Hope International School (HIS), if they’ll be sending the books to you.
